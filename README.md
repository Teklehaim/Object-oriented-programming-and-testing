## The Salary.py Project##
This is a simple project to show the inheritance and polymorphism.

Both the Manager and TeamLeader classes are using the same class methods to print name, title and salary that are defined in the base Employee class,

However, each of them modify how the salary is calculated and what title fits well to each class.

In the main method, three objects are created: one for Employee type, another one Manager Type, and another  TeamLeader type. 

Printing the title and the salary is used to check if the inheritance and polymorphism was properly implemented.
