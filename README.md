## The Salary.py Project
This is a simple project to show the inheritance and polymorphism.

Both the Manager and TeamLeader classes are using the same class methods to print name, title and salary that are defined in the base Employee class. However, each of them modify how the salary is calculated and what title fits well to each class. In the main method, three objects are created: one for Employee type, another one Manager Type, and another  TeamLeader type. Printing the title and the salary is used to check if the inheritance and polymorphism was properly implemented.

### The TestSalary.py Project
  - Contains simple tests based on the implementation of the Salar.py project.
  - The tests cover each unit in the project.
  - A single test per unit
  - All classes and each attributes for each class are tested.
